	--- ABOUT ---
	
	A stripped down PHP implementation of the URL matching features in 
	the Twitter Javascript library. Useful if you want to post arbitrary
	length URLs to Twitter's API that could get shortened to t.co URLs.
	
	Features:
	* Find URLs in strings exactly like Twitter, yay!
	* Fully UTF-8 compatible! Brilliant!
	
	Based on May 07th 2013 version of twitter-text:
	https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text-js/blob/8fc58b631d6f56ca1817d4aedb60d214f2df770b/twitter-text.js
	
	PHP v5.4+ requried for anonymous functions (with $this calls) in regexSupplant() and stringSupplant().
	If that's a problem you could rewrite the functions to use regular callbacks:

	--- USAGE ---
	
	Just call:
	match($query, $withIndicies = true);
